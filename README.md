koobkooc---a-reverse-cookbook
=============================

This is a reverse cookbook program.  The progam uses a SQLite database to keep track of what meats and vegetables go with what recipes.  This database is dynamic so that it can be user customized, but will in the final version come preloaded with a few standard recipes.
